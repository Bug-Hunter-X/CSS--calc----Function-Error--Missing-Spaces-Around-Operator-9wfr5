The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function to dynamically calculate values.  The error lies in the missing spaces around the '+' operator within the `calc()` function. This is a subtle bug that can lead to unexpected results or even cause the browser to ignore the entire `calc()` expression:

```css
.element { 
  width:calc(100px+20%);
}
```

This code is attempting to set the width of the `.element` to 100px plus 20% of the containing element's width. However, due to the lack of spaces, the browser interprets it incorrectly.  The correct version requires spaces around the '+' operator:

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(100px + 20%);
}
```
