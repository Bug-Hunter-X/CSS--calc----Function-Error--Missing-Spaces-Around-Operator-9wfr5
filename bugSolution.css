The corrected CSS code, fixing the missing spaces around the '+' operator:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 20%);
}
```

This version correctly calculates the width as 100px plus 20% of the parent container's width.  Remember this applies to all operators within `calc()`, such as `-`, `*`, and `/`. Always add spaces for reliable calculations.
